# Changelog

## 0.5.0

### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* Updated artifact and memory service interface to be async. Agents that
  interact with these services through callbacks or tools will now need to
  adjust their invocation methods to be async (using await), or ensure calls
  are wrapped in an asynchronous executor like asyncio.run(). Any service that
  extends the base interface must also be updated.

### Features

* Introduced the ability to chain model callbacks.
* Added support for async agent and model callbacks.
* Added input transcription support for live/streaming.
* Captured all agent code error and display on UI.
* Set param required tag to False by default in openapi_tool.
* Updated evaluation functions to be asynchronous.

### Bug Fixes

* Ensured a unique ID is generated for every event.
* Fixed the issue when openapi_specparser has parameter.required as None.
* Updated the 'type' value on the items/properties nested structures for Anthropic models to adhere to JSON schema.
* Fix litellm error issues.

### Miscellaneous Chores

* Regenerated API docs.
* Created a `developer` folder and added samples.
* Updated the contributing guide.
* Docstring improvements, typo fixings, GitHub action to enforce code styles on formatting and imports, etc.

## 0.4.0

### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES
* Set the max size of strings in database columns. MySQL mandates that all VARCHAR-type fields must specify their lengths.
* Extract content encode/decode logic to a shared util, resolve issues with JSON serialization, and update key length for DB table to avoid key too long issue in mysql.
* Enhance `FunctionTool` to verify if the model is providing all the mandatory arguments.

### Features
* Update ADK setup guide to improve onboarding experience.
* feat: add ordering to recent events in database session service.
* feat(llm_flows): support async before/after tool callbacks.
* feat: Added --replay and --resume options to adk run cli. Check adk run --help for more details.
* Created a new Integration Connector Tool (underlying of the ApplicationIntegrationToolSet) so that we do not force LLM to provide default value.

### Bug Fixes

* Don't send content with empty text to LLM.
* Fix google search reading undefined for `renderedContent`.

### Miscellaneous Chores
* Docstring improvements, typo fixings, github action to enfore code styles on formatting and imports, etc.

## 0.3.0

* Auth: expose `access_token` and `refresh_token` at top level of auth
  credentials, instead of a `dict`
  ([commit](https://github.com/google/adk-python/commit/956fb912e8851b139668b1ccb8db10fd252a6990)).

### Features

* Added support for running agents with MCPToolset easily on `adk web`.
* Added `custom_metadata` field to `LlmResponse`, which can be used to tag
  LlmResponse via `after_model_callback`.
* Added `--session_db_url` to `adk deploy cloud_run` option.
* Many Dev UI improvements:
  * Better google search result rendering.
  * Show websocket close reason in Dev UI.
  * Better error message showing for audio/video.

### Bug Fixes

* Fixed MCP tool json schema parsing issue.
* Fixed issues in DatabaseSessionService that leads to crash.
* Fixed functions.py.
* Fixed `skip_summarization` behavior in `AgentTool`.

### Miscellaneous Chores

* Various code improvements.
* Various typo fixes.
* Bump min version of google-genai to 1.11.0.

## 0.2.0

### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* Fix typo in method name in `Event`: has_trailing_code_exeuction_result --> has_trailing_code_execution_result.

### Features

* `adk` CLI:
  * Introduce `adk create` cli tool to help creating agents.
  * Adds `--verbosity` option to `adk deploy cloud_run` to show detailed cloud
    run deploy logging.
* Improve the initialization error message for `DatabaseSessionService`.
* Lazy loading for Google 1P tools to minimize the initial latency.
* Support emitting state-change-only events from planners.
* Lots of Dev UI updates, including:
  * Show planner thoughts and actions in the Dev UI.
  * Support MCP tools in Dev UI.
    (NOTE: `agent.py` interface is temp solution and is subject to change)
  * Auto-select the only app if only one app is available.
  * Show grounding links generated by Google Search Tool.
* `.env` file is reloaded on every agent run.

### Bug Fixes

* `LiteLlm`: arg parsing error and python 3.9 compatibility.
* `DatabaseSessionService`: adds the missing fields; fixes event with empty
  content not being persisted.
* Google API Discovery response parsing issue.
* `load_memory_tool` rendering issue in Dev UI.
* Markdown text overflows in Dev UI.

### Miscellaneous Chores

* Adds unit tests in Github action.
